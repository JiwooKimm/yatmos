##### Abstract

Though widely used in the lower atmosphere for both operational and scientific purposes, data
assimilation techniques have yet to be extensively adopted in the mesosphere, thermosphere, and
ionosphere. This is despite the inherent benefits obtained by combining observations with a
background model using data assimilation. In order to improve representation of variability in
the mesosphere, thermosphere, and ionosphere, as well as provide initial conditions for studying
predictability of the near-Earth space weather, the data assimilation capability was developed for
the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and WACCM with
thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed
(DART) ensemble Kalman filter. A brief overview of the development of WACCM+DART and
WACCMX+DART will be provided, including how the application of data assimilation
techniques differs between the lower and upper atmospheres. Drawing on several examples, it
will be shown that using data assimilation can improve representation of the variability in the
middle and upper atmospheres, including for chemical transport, dynamical variability, and
thermosphere neutral density. The use of WACCMX+DART for providing initial conditions for
forecasting the space environment will also be presented.

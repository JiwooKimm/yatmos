#### Abstract
Gravity waves are ubiquitous in all convectively stable atmospheres. They have been extensively studied on Earth, and there is a rapidly growing number of observations on other planets. The talk will review a recent progress with detecting gravity waves, understanding their fundamental role in atmospheric dynamics and exploring the related effects. Mars is the most studied planet after Earth, therefore a significant part of the talk is dedicated to our red neighbor. Gravity wave signatures have been observed as far as on Pluto. Most recently, gravity waves measured by Cassini helped to resolve the so-called "energy crisis": to explain the anomalously hot thermospheres of Saturn and Jupiter.

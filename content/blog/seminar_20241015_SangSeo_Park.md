To study the air quality and public health for particulate matter (PM), we need to know the chemical composition of PM2.5. Various characteristics of chemical compositions of PM2.5 is also affected to overall optical properties of aerosols. Over East Asia, various aerosol types are emitted from anthropogenic and natural sources, and the presence of various aerosol types can affect the optical properties of the atmospheric layer. In particular, continuous changes in industrial activity can affect the long-term characteristics of aerosol emissions, as observed in several countries. 
To precisely understand this, we analyze the long-term changes in the frequency and optical properties of aerosol types using various aerosol type classification algorithms using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), and the satellite-based Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Also, we simultaneously analyzed in-situ observations through SPARTAN (Surface Particulate Matter Network) and remote-sensing data through AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network). In this study, we used SPARTAN and AERONET data from 2016 to 2022 in 11 global observation sites to evaluate the accuracy of aerosol type classification method from optical-based variables.

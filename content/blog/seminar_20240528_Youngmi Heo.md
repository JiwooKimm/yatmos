##### Abstract

In this presentation, the main focus is on the introduction of wavelets, with special
attention to wavelet filters and wavelet coefficients. Wavelet filters are essential for
generating wavelet coefficients, yet constructing these filters can be challenging,
especially when aiming to achieve specific properties. Wavelet coefficients are useful
for extracting fine details from the broader context within datasets, effectively
isolating high-frequency components from low-frequency ones. We will also discuss
how the Laplacian pyramid algorithm, an alternative method, enables the acquisition
of wavelet coefficients without the direct need for wavelet filters. If time permits, we
will explore a novel method for incorporating wavelet features into deep learning
algorithms.

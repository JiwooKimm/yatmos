#### Abstract
Venus and Earth are considered sister planets because of their similar radius and mass, and
close distance to each other. These two planets were supposed to have similar atmospheres
at their formation. However, current Venus is completely different from Earth. For example,
the surface of Venus is not a good place for life due to its extreme atmospheric pressure and
temperature (about 90 bar and 740 K). Interestingly, recent Venus orbiters provided exciting
clues about the variabilities of Venus’s atmosphere across the globe and over time. To find
mechanisms behind the reported variabilities, more observations are mandatory. Our better
understanding of the current status of the planet may be the key to gauging its past. In this
seminar, I would like to introduce how our knowledge of Venus has been shaped by
observations and highlights of recent findings.

#### Abstract
 In first part of this talk, I will demonstrate that deep learning successfully detects
the emerging climate change signals in daily precipitation fields during the observed record.
Accordingly, we trained a convolutional neural network with daily precipitation fields and
annual mean global mean surface air temperature data obtained from an ensemble of presentday and future climate model simulations. After applying the algorithm to the observational
record, we found that the daily precipitation data represented an excellent predictor for the
observed planetary warming, as they have showed a clear deviation from natural variability
since the mid-2010s.
 In second part, a deep-learning-based global oceanic data assimilation system, will be
referred as DeepDA system, will be introduced. DeepDA is formulated by incorporating a
partial convolutional neural network and a generative adversarial network (GAN). The
partial convolution acts as an observation operator that projects the irregular observational
information on gridded fields, and the GAN model brings in the observational information
from previous time frames. Observing system simulation experiments showed that the
analysis error in the DeepDA-produced three-dimensional temperature is systematically
reduced compared to both the background and observed values.

#### Abstract
Low-earth orbiting satellites have been observing the global distribution of air pollution for decades identifying pollution sources, temporal trends, and links to health effects and community disparities. However, these historical measurements have been limited in spatial and temporal information, which challenges data interpretation and product validation. In this seminar, Dr. Judd will share a story of how air quality field campaigns over the last decade have helped with preparations for the next generation of air quality satellites that are breaking the barriers in spatial and temporal resolution. Much of the focus will be on airborne capabilities, as a satellite proxy, observing trace gases like nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde at high temporal and spatial resolutions unveiling unique spatiotemporal patterns over major cities. However, the full illustration only comes together through the integration of satellite, airborne, ground, and modeling capabilities as part of the integrated observing system for air quality. Specific topics discussed include conceptual models of air quality episodes in coastal-urban environments, satellite/model/emissions evaluation, and exciting next steps as new datasets are collected this winter throughout Asia.

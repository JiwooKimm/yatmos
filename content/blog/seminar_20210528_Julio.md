#### Abstract

Climate sensitivity refers to the response of the climate system to a doubling of atmospheric
CO2. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), the long-term change in global mean surface
temperatures after an abrupt increase in CO2, is an important metric for comparing different
coupled climate models, as well as for evaluating individual climate models as they incorporate
new physical parameterizations. This talk will examine ECS in two versions of the Community
Earth System Model (CESM). The most recent round of the Climate Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP6) revealed dramatic increases in ECS for many leading climate models including
CESM. Our analysis will show that increased ECS in CESM2, the most recent version of CESM
can be traced to changes in the behavior of Southern Ocean clouds as well as tropical clouds.
Finally, we will present new results from paleoclimate studies that suggest the climate
sensitivity of CESM2 is indeed too high.

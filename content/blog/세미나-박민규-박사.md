#### Abstract
Wave interference between the daily atmospheric circulation and its
climatological mean is a key process that modulates midlatitude weather.
Here, we find that the wave interference over the North Pacific Ocean is an
important driver of North American wintertime cold and heavy precipitation
extremes in the present climate, but that this relationship is projected to
weaken under increasing greenhouse gas emissions. When daily circulation
anomalies are in-phase with the climatological mean state, the anomalous
transport of heat and moisture causes the enhanced occurrence of cold
extremes across the continental U.S. and a significant decrease of heavy
precipitation extremes in the western U.S. In a future emissions scenario,
the climatological stationary wave over the eastern North Pacific weakens
and shifts spatially, which alters and generally weakens the relationship
between wave interference and North American climate extremes. Our
results underscore that the prediction of changes in regional wave
interference is pivotal for understanding the future regional climate
variability.

##### Abstract
Atmospheric aerosols are recognized as one of the most important factors in climate change research as they directly and indirectly affect the Earth’s thermodynamic and radiative energy budgets. Aerosol particles emitted by natural and anthropogenic sources undergo hygroscopic growth depending on their properties and the chemical reactions that occur in the atmosphere. Depending on aerosol
properties, including size, mixing state, chemical composition and hygroscopicity, the degree of hygroscopic growth of aerosols can be determined. Sufficiently grown aerosol particles can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which affect cloud formation and play an essential role in modulating radiative properties. They also influence the processes leading to the formation of rain, snow, hail and other
 forms of precipitation. Therefore, scientific understanding of the hygroscopic properties of aerosols and CCN is necessary to understand and assess aerosol-cloud interactions and their impact on climate. The seminar will cover the measurement of ambient aerosol and CCN conducted on the Korean Peninsula and the development of hygroscopicity measurement system, broad supersaturation
 scanning-CCN (BS2-CCN) system. Additionally, the seminar will cover recent studies including ice nucleating particles (INPs) measurement and introduction of the KIST cloud chamber for cloud-aerosol interaction studies.

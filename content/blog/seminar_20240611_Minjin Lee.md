##### Abstract

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Earth System Model (ESM)’s land component is
designed to capture coupled water, energy, carbon, and/or nutrient dynamics within
vegetation, soils, rivers, and lakes. The standalone Land Model (LM) has evolved in
different versions over the last decades, with applications to problems of direct
relevance to society.
I will begin by describing the structure and applications of LM3-Terrestrial and
Aquatic Nitrogen (TAN) at regional (e.g., Susquehanna and Mississippi River Basins,
South Korea) to global scales. LM3-TAN has been used to explore the combined
effects of terrestrial and climate perturbations (e.g., increasing land use, fertilizer
applications, atmospheric CO2, and climate variability/extremes) on ocean and
atmosphere pollution, and provided important implications for emerging
environmental problems and effective mitigation strategies.
In the second part of this talk, the development of a global, spatially explicit, process-
based model, Freshwater Algae, Nutrient, and Solid Cycling and Yields (FANSY), will
be discussed. FANSY is intended as a baseline for eventual linking of global
terrestrial and ocean biogeochemistry in next generation Earth System Models to
project global changes that may challenge empirical approaches. LM3-FANSY
simulates suspended solids, nitrogen, and phosphorus in multiple forms
(particulate/dissolved, organic/inorganic) and multiple units (yield, load, and
concentration) across a globally distributed set of large rivers and in global amounts,
with an accuracy comparable to other global freshwater nutrient and suspended solid
models.
Finally, I will discuss the recent development of a new soil biogeochemistry model,
GFDL mIcrobial-MIneral Carbon in Soil (GIMICS). GIMICS integrates the state-of-
the-art features of two emerging models: 1) microbial dynamics and soil
physicochemical properties of the MIcrobial-Mineral Carbon Stabilization model
(MIMICS) and 2) rhizosphere dynamics of the Carbon, Organisms, Rhizosphere, and
Protection in the Soil Environment model (CORPSE). GIMICS also includes
previously neglected processes in both models, such as bioturbation/diffusion,
advection, runoff, baseflow, and dissolved organic carbon cycling. GIMICS has been
coupled with the dynamic vegetation model, Perfect Plasticity Approximation (PPA),
within the latest Land Model LM4. This new development effort is aimed at resolving
shortcomings of the first-generation soil biogeochemistry models (e.g., CENTURY)
which are included in most current Earth System Models. The first-generation soil
biogeochemistry models have been criticized for their first-order kinetics that do not
properly represent processes of soil organic matter decomposition and stabilization
in response to changing climate and socioeconomic development.

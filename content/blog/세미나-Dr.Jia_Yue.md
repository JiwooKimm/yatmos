#### Abstract

In this talk, I will introduce my work with gravity waves in nightglow, from ground-based measurements to spaceborne sensors to machine learning. Many case studies will be presented, such as typhoons, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, thunderstorms, mountain waves. The connection between geospace (ionosphere, thermosphere) and meteorology via the generation, propagation and dissipation of gravity waves will be introduced. I will also introduce our new citizen science project, spritacular, to investigate TLEs (transient luminescent events) with citizen scientists.

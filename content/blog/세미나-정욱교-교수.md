#### Abstract
Various types of measurement parameters are essential components for understanding and predicting the Earth system. Satellite-derived data have provided global information on terrestrial systems including atmospheric composition, clouds, meteorology, ocean, vegetation, and snow/ice properties. Reliable networked ground-based measurements are essential to provide independent measurements and ancillary information for validating and consistency-checking satellite-based products. In this talk, I would like to share some of my experiences on how ground-based measurements can benefit/support global Earth system sciences, by taking examples of several international field campaigns such as the Seven South East Asian Studies (7-SEAS), High-Mountain-Asia (HMA), GEMS Map of Air Pollution (GMAP) campaign. Particularly during the HMA campaign, I will present snow and ice property measurements in addition to the atmospheric compositions and meteorology over the Himalayan mountains for estimating the effects of absorbing aerosols on the cryosphere, and thereby hydrology systems over the downstream region. This interdisciplinary study is an excellent example showing the merit of ground-based measurements which includes cryosphere, hydrology, meteorology, and atmospheric chemistry to better understand mutual feedback between the comprehensive terrestrial parameters affecting regional and global society.

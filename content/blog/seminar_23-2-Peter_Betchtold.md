#### Abstract
It is in honour to be invited and give a talk at Yonsei University in Hye Yeongs group As we are a global prediction center, the talk will first shortly cover different aspects of global modelling mostly related to the tropics we ( covered in the last 1 2 years and found particularly interesting and challenging are there common model biases and are they related to air sea coupling? what about the diurnal cycle of convection, the challenging Cu to Sc transitions in the East Pacific, a representative tropical cyclone text book case. 

In the second part we cover important aspects in terms of tropical ensemble predictions and predictability in general, including the representation of tropical variability and tropical convectively coupled waves. 

Finally, in the third part we look ahead when we (like others) experiment with km scale resolutions, where the main challenges indeed are in the tropical organisation of convection and gravity waves (both orographic and convectively generated) Lastly, a word on machine learning performance in global predictions

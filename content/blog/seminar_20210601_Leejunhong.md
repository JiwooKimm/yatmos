#### Abstract

The efforts have been taken to perform the simulation at a higher resolution. The stormresolving simulation is one of the approaches to reduce the uncertainty due to convective
parameterization. A much higher resolution is needed to resolve shallow convection which
is also another major source of uncertainty. However, the previous turbulence
parameterization is not valid on this scale. In the present work, the 3D Smagorinsky
turbulence scheme is implemented in the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) model,
which enables the ICON model to perform even at the scale in large-eddy simulations.
The details of the implementation and evaluations are discussed. Implemented 3D
Smagorinsky turbulence scheme reproduces the mean profiles of reference model well. In
addition, the applications using the 3D Smagorinsky turbulence scheme are briefly
introduced.

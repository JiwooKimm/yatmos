##### Abstract
Monitoring long-term trends in stratospheric hydrogen chloride (HCl) is essential for predicting
our climate as well as for ozone recovery. To better understand the changes in its concentration
and the underlying physical processes in recent years, the specified-dynamics version of the
Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM) and the satellite measurements of
HCl from NASA’s Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) are used in this study. The interannual
variability of HCl in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes is influenced strongly by the
stratospheric large-scale circulation and climate variability. For instance, the vertical wind shear

associated with the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) can explain much of the year-
to-year variability in HCl in NH midlatitude in winter months. However, this relationship seems

to have weakened in recent years after the first disruption in the QBO in 2015-2016. Other
sources of climate variability, such as sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events could have
played a role in the circulation that contributed to variability in HCl. Our results show that not
only the changes in the surface emissions but also the large-scale circulation related to the
climate variability in the stratosphere appear to have significant impact on the long-term trends
of stratospheric HCl.

#### Abstract
While there are many challenges associated with developing convection
parameterization, one major issue that has recently gained attention is stochastic
convection parameterization. In this study, we investigate the physical processes that
generate convective cloud variabilities and develop a stochastic parameterization that
simulates the mean and variance of convective tendencies based on the unified convection
scheme (UNICON). By extending UNICON, we develop a stochastic UNICON with
convective updraft plumes at the surface randomly sampled from the correlated
multivariate Gaussian distribution for updraft vertical velocity and thermodynamic scalars.
The updraft plume radius at the surface follows a power-law distribution with a specified
scale break radius. In addition to the stochastic initialization at the near-surface, a
stochastic mixing model with a machine learning technique is proposed. Stochastic
UNICON is tested using a single column model and a global climate model, and the
simulation results indicates that stochastic UNICON improves the simulation of mean states
and intraseasonal variabilities.

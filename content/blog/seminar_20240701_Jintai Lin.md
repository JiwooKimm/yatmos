##### Abstract

Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO 2 ) are a major air pollutant which undergoes substantial
fine-scale spatiotemporal variations associated with complex emission sources and nonlinear
chemistry. Current ground-based concentration measurements and emission datasets can hardly
capture the fine-scale spatial details of NOx. Satellite remote sensing provides a great opportunity
to estimate NOx pollution and their emissions at high resolution. Our decade-long endeavor has
established an advanced algorithm (POMINO) to retrieve tropospheric vertical column densities
(VCDs) of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) from three satellite instruments (OMI, TROPOMI and GEMS).
POMINO allows an explicit representation of how aerosol absorption and scattering affect the
NO 2 retrieval, among other special features. Recently, we have also developed a fast, reliable
algorithm (PHLET) to retrieve NOx emissions at high spatial resolution (≤ 5 km), by accounting
for the nonlinear chemistry (i.e., concentration-dependent lifetime) and horizontal transport at
individual locations. Applying POMINO and PHLET to Asia reveals many important emission
sources which are missing in current anthropogenic emission inventories and natural emission
datasets. At the moment, we are taking a further step to estimate NOx emissions at an
unprecedented resolution of 1 km, by combining satellite NO 2 data, physics-based emission
inversion and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These data will provide crucial information to support
future-generation satellite mission, air quality and climate modeling and targeted emission
mitigation.

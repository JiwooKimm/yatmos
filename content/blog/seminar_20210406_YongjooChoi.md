#### Abstract
Understanding the global distribution of atmospheric black carbon (BC) is essential to unveil its
climatic effect, but there are still large uncertainties regarding the simulation of BC transport due to
inadequate information about emission rates and removal process. To assess the (1) bottom-up emission
inventories and (2) wet removal scheme in FLEXible PARTicle model (FLEXPART version 10.4), the
black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) ratios were investigated from long-term (2010 to 2016),
harmonized observations under different conditions (affected and unaffected by wet deposition) at four
sites in East Asia, including two sites in Korea (Baengnyeong and Gosan) and two sites in Japan (Noto
and Fukuoka). First, by excluding wet deposition effects based on accumulated precipitation along
trajectory (APT), the measured ΔBC/ΔCO ratios were used to validate the Regional Emission inventory
in ASia (REAS) version 2.1. The BC/CO ratios from the REAS emission inventory (7.7 ng m −3 ppb −1 for
East China – 23.2 ng m −3 ppb −1 for South Korea) were overestimated by factors of 1.1 for East China to
3.0 for South Korea, whereas the ratio for North Korea (3.7 ng m −3 ppb −1 from REAS) was underestimated
by a factor of 2.0, most likely due to inaccurate emissions from the road transportation sector. The
overestimation in Seoul, the southwestern regions of South Korea, and Northeast China was noticeable,
and underestimation was mainly observed in the western regions in North Korea, including Pyongyang.
Second, according to the relationship between APT and transport efficiency (TE; the ratio of
ΔBC/ΔCO affected and unaffected by APT), the wet removal efficiency was lower in East and North
China but higher in South Korea and Japan, implying the importance of the aging process and frequency
of exposure to below- and in-cloud scavenging conditions during airmass transport. Moreover, the wet
scavenging in winter and summer showed the highest and lowest efficiency, respectively, although the
lowest removal efficiency in summer was primarily associated with a reduced BC aging process because
the in-cloud scavenging condition was dominant. By comparing TE from the FLEXPART, we found that
the scavenging coefficients of the below- and in-cloud calculated by following the FLEXPART scheme
were slightly overestimated by a factor of 1.7 and highly underestimated by 1 order of magnitude
compared to the measured values, respectively. Using artificial neural networks, the convective available
potential energy, which is well known as an indicator of vertical instability, should be considered in the
in-cloud scavenging process to improve the representative regional difference in BC wet scavenging over
East Asia. This study suggested an effective and straightforward evaluation method for bottom-up
emission inventories and wet scavenging schemes for BC by introducing ΔBC/ΔCO ratio and APT.

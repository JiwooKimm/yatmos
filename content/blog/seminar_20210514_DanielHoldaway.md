#### Abstract
The Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) is developing the Joint Effort for
Data assimilation Integration (JEDI). JEDI is built using a generic software infrastructure making it
reusable and sharable between weather forecast centers around the World. Unlike legacy data
assimilation system JEDI can function using any model grid and set of fields. FV3-JEDI will form the
interface between JEDI and the atmospheric components of models formulated using the FV3 (Finite
Volume cubed-sphere) dynamical core. These models include NASA’s GEOS model and NOAA’s
GFS model. Similarly an interface is being formulated between the ocean and sea-ice components of
these models and JEDI. In this talk we will describe the effort towards constructing these systems and
report on the progress towards achieving operationally viable data assimilation using the JEDI data
assimilation system.

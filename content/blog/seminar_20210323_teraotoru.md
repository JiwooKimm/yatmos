#### Abstract
We are now conducting new Asian hydroclimatological project, the Asian Precipitation
Experiment (AsiaPEX), which is the successor of the GAME and the MAHASRI projects
under the GHP/GEWEX/WCRP leading the joint activity of the Asian hydroclimatological
research community. The objectives of the AsiaPEX are defined as &quot;understanding of Asian
land precipitation over diverse hydroclimatological conditions and multiple time scales for
better prediction, disaster reduction, and sustainable development.&quot; The AsiaPEX does not
pursue a geographical region-oriented strategy, but a research approach-oriented strategy,
which focuses on 1) observation and estimation of variation and extremes in Asian land
precipitation, 2) process studies of Asian land precipitation focusing on diverse land-
atmosphere coupling, 3) understanding and prediction of the variability of Asian monsoon
from subseasonal to interdecadal time scales, 4) high-resolution land surface hydrological
modeling and monitoring incorporating impacts of human activities, 5) coordinated
observation and modeling initiatives, 6) detection and projection of the climate change
impact on regional precipitation in Asia. Recent development of the AsiaPEX activity will be
reviewed briefly.
The impact of the climate change is one of the key research targets of AsiaPEX because of
the acceleration of the global warming in recent decades. It is our mission to clarify the
future change of the Asian hydroclimatological system, which has huge impact on the
people in Asia. For this purpose, climate models are important tool. Recent research on the
limitation of current climate models will be reviewed, to elucidate the difficulties and impacts
of reproduction of the monsoon onset process. I will review the research on the Asian
monsoon heating process and will propose yet another analysis method. It is based on the
mass conservation law of the upper tropospheric high potential temperature airmass, and
lower tropospheric high equivalent potential temperature airmass. A case study of the
evolution of Asian summer monsoon in 2017 showed an important role of the lower
tropospheric northward inflow over the Bay of Bengal, which causes active pre-monsoon
severe storms over the Bengal Plain. The relative role of the heating by the elevated land
surface over the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding convective activity will be discussed.
